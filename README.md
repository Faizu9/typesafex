## Features

- **Runtime Contracts**: Define conditions that must be met during execution.
- **Type Enforcement**: Ensure that variables and function parameters are of the expected types.
- **Bug Prevention**: Catch issues early in the development cycle.
- **Enhanced Code Quality**: Write cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce time spent on debugging and testing.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easily extend functionality with custom plugins.

## Installation

To install Typesafex, you can use pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install typesafex
```

After installation, verify that it was successful by checking the version:

```bash
typesafex --version
```

## Usage

Using Typesafex is straightforward. Import the library in your Python script and start defining contracts and type checks. Here’s a simple example:

```python
from typesafex import contract

@contract
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)  # This works
result = add(5, "3")  # This will raise a runtime error
```

## Examples

### Basic Contract

You can define a contract to check if a number is positive:

```python
from typesafex import contract

@contract
def square(x: int) -> int:
    assert x >= 0, "x must be non-negative"
    return x * x

print(square(4))  # Outputs: 16
print(square(-4))  # Raises AssertionError
```

### Type Enforcement

Typesafex can enforce types at runtime, ensuring that your function parameters are of the correct type:

```python
from typesafex import enforce

@enforce
def multiply(x: float, y: float) -> float:
    return x * y

print(multiply(2.5, 4.0))  # Outputs: 10.0
print(multiply(2.5, "4"))  # Raises TypeError
```

### Combining Contracts and Type Checks

You can combine both contracts and type checks for more robust code:

```python
from typesafex import contract, enforce

@contract
@enforce
def divide(x: float, y: float) -> float:
    assert y != 0, "y cannot be zero"
    return x / y

print(divide(10, 2))  # Outputs: 5.0
print(divide(10, 0))  # Raises AssertionError
```
